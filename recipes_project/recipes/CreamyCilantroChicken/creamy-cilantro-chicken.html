    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If using standard chicken breasts, put chicken between sheets of plastic wrap and flatten to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch (not necessary if using already thin breasts). Best served with cubed red potatoes, baked at 350F for 30 minutes in olive oil (with parsley and seasoned salt to taste), or with a side of green beans or asparagus stovetop-cooked in butter on medium-high for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 thin skinless, boneless chicken breasts </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>¾ cup heavy cream </li>
        <li>½ cup halved cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat chicken breasts dry and sprinkle with 1/2 the Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to the very hot oil and cook, turning occasionally, until juices run clear when chicken is pricked with a fork and both sides are browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside, reserving drippings in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add green onions and bell pepper to the drippings in the skillet. Cook until tender, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth and wine and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Simmer until juices have reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes more. Add cream and continue to simmer to reduce slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cilantro, plus remaining Cajun seasoning. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to the skillet, cover, and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
