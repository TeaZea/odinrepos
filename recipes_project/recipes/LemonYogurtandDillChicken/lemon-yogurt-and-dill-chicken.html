    <p>Unique spin on a Greek dish!</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients for Veggies</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 small russet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch wedges</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, cut into 1/2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>5 large radishes, trimmed and cut into wedges</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Ingredients for Chicken</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup whole-milk plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 small lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes, onion, carrots, and radishes in a large bowl. Drizzle with oil, and toss to coat. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon dill, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Toss again to coat. Pour veggies out onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the veggies bake, prepare the chicken. In the same bowl the veggies were in, add the Greek yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon dill, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Mix until thoroughly combined. Dip each chicken thigh into the yogurt mixture, making sure each one is evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from the oven, and gently push the veggies to the sides of the pan, leaving room in the middle for the chicken thighs. Place the thighs in the middle of the baking sheet, and place pan back into the oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, and veggies are tender, 30 to 40 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). If desired, place pan beneath broiler, and broil chicken for a few minutes to brown the chicken. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste before serving.</li>
