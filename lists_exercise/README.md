# TOP_lists_exercise
List assignment from The Odin Project
To get some practice using lists, create a new HTML document and create the following lists:

    An unordered shopping list of your favorite foods
    An ordered list of todo’s you need to get done today
    An unordered list of places you’d like to visit someday
    An ordered list of your all time top 5 favorite video games or movies
